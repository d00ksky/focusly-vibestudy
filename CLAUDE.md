# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

**Focusly-VibeStudy** is a mobile-first Pomodoro timer app that combines productivity with gamification and entertainment. The app features:

- **Pomodoro Timer**: Focus sessions to boost productivity
- **Virtual Pet**: A cute mascot that grows happier as you study
- **Meme Breaks**: Curated memes during rest periods
- **Anime-style Design**: Kawaii aesthetics and adorable animations

## Current Status

This is a **greenfield project** in early development phase. The repository currently contains only documentation files with no code implementation yet.

## Target Platform

Mobile-first development targeting iOS and Android platforms.

## Development Commands

*To be updated once tech stack is determined*

Currently no build, test, or development commands are available as the project is in the planning phase.

## Architecture Notes

The project is conceptually divided into these core components:

1. **Timer Engine**: Pomodoro session management and tracking
2. **Pet System**: Virtual pet that responds to study activity
3. **Meme Service**: Curated content delivery for break periods
4. **UI/UX**: Anime-style mobile interface with animations

## Next Steps for Development

When beginning implementation, key decisions needed:
- Mobile framework selection (React Native, Flutter, native iOS/Android)
- State management approach for timer and pet systems
- Meme content delivery strategy
- Animation framework for anime-style UI
